# **Simulation Evolve Hunting and Foraging**
## **Description**
- The simulation cultivates evolutionary robotics with the capacity to function as both prey and predator performing complex tasks like hunting and foraging food.
- Featuring highly adaptable environmental settings like vision rays, fitness evaluation, agent spawning mechanisms,
etc.
- Used as the foundation for Honor Thesis and an ongoing research paper, highlighting its central role in both
academic and scientific contexts.
